# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
Pass by reference means that the value that is passed in is referenced by its location in memory, where as pass by value means that there is no reference to the location but rather just the value. Pass by reference is mutable.
