# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. The example shown is not proper json because it does not have double quotes around the keys.
